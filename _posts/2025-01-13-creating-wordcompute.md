The other day during lunch I had the idea, urge almost, to create a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) / [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com/) mashup game. Since time was limited and I wanted to play my new game ASAP, I decided to enlist ChatGPT to write the game for me. I had never used AI to complete a project in entirety, so this was a good learning exercise. 

I'll be the first to admit that I am pretty green when it comes to AI. I haven't spent a lot of time using it or learning about it. We use [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) at work, but I use it sparingly. Prompting ChatGPT to create the game was interesting and frustrating at times. ChatGPT did a good job of getting the initial board and keyboard layout setup. There were some bugs with the logic along the way that I had to prompt to get fixed. Most of the prompts revolved around styling (I am terrible at front end design). Having to copy/paste the code changes after every prompt and then test those changes was quite annoying to say the least. Overall though, ChatGPT gave me a working game in a relatively short period of time. 

I don't think I would use ChatGPT, or any LLM, to develop a larger project from start to finish. I think it is a great tool for assisting you along the way, but I honestly think it would slow the development process down if utilizing it for the entire project. Improving my prompts would definitely make things easier, I will try to do some research on how to improve my prompts. 

This was a fun little project to work on. I have made some minor improvements in the last few days since deploying the initial version based on feedback from friends and family that have been playing the game. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please let me know!
